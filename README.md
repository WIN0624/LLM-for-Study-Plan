## ✨ Integrated Framework with Customized LLMs Metrics

This tutorial are **beginner friendly**! This repository aims to help users customize their own LLMs for domain-specific tasks at a low cost. By using this framework, you will not only obtain a fine-tuned LLMs for your task but also gain a well-customized metric/rubric integrating human feedbacks to evaluate responses generated by the LLM. 

With this rubric you can advance your works or even merge it into your promts to guide LLM-based labeling for your dataset.
